# Lane Detection for ADAS
## Major Project
The number of deaths due to car accidents has increased over the past few decades. According to data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), a total of 4,03,116 road accident cases were reported in 2021, up from 3,54,796 road accidents in 2020. An additional 20 to 50 million people suffer non-fatal injuries, often resulting in long-term disability. This is mostly caused by human error. 
This means that there are still thousands of people who have died due to poor driving skills. Moreover, due to continuous denial and low awareness among drivers, many accidents remain unreported. The driving system is the brain of any car whether it is manual or automatic. Drivers want to maintain their focus on the road instead of spending time on using Bluetooth or other distractions to reduce speeding fines and reduce taxes. ADAS can significantly improve vehicle safety by incorporating key driving assistance functions such as: maintaining a safe distance, controlling braking patterns and acceleration, controlling speed, followed by lane keeping and steering. In a consumer survey conducted by LexisNexis Risk Solutions, ADAS vehicles showed a 27% reduction in bodily injury claim frequency and a 19% reduction in property damage frequency.
The problem statement for the given task is to “Develop a lane detection model that can be used by the self-driving vehicle for identification of the road lanes to provide assistance to the driver”.
